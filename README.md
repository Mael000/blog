If you want, you can fork this project and try it. Once you have downloaded the code, you must install the NPM dependencies with npm install. Then you can run the code with gatsby develop. That's it!

### How to contribute

If you want to contribute, you can:

* have a look at the article that you can find under the _blog_ folder, and see if there are __grammar errors__, sentences not clear and so on. I'd really appreciate that, since I'm not a native English speaker.
* help me with the structure of the React components. I've never worked with React before this redesign, so I'm sure I have not followed best practices.
* help me with UI issues. I'm not used to frontend development, so there's LOT to do to achieve a good result.
* if you found anything, open an Issue here on GitHub! 

### How NOT to contribute

* If you find errors about the __topic of the article__, or you want to add more info about a concept, don't do it here. Please, write your comment directly on the website. Since I'm writing this blog so that I can share and learn at the same time, if there is something that other can learn too thanks to your content, I'd like the give them the possibility to access it in the easiest way. 


__THANK YOU!__
