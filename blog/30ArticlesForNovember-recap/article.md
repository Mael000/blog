For this November I decided to share each day an article on Twitter.

https://twitter.com/bellonedavide/status/1189474483503022081


I did it for simple reasons:

*  share great content with the Twitter community
*  recognize author's work by sharing and promote it
*  discover new things and see the world from a different point of view
*  achieve the goal of reading __at least__ an article each day 


Here's the recap

----
On November I did my best 

trying to share an article each day.

I completed my own quest, 

and here comes my links array.  

---

Most of them were on C sharp, 

on some things I thought were dull.

I went deep in, like in a scarp, 

with [indexers](https://csharp-station.com/Tutorial/CSharp/Lesson11), [lazy](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/top-7-least-known-but-important-c-sharp-features/), [LINQ](https://blog.quadiontech.com/5-c-features-that-will-help-you-to-understand-linq-bca495cd3fb8) and [null](https://mikaelkoskinen.net/post/subtle-csharp-bug-null-conditional-operator-any-false).

You can be a [string or a String](https://blog.paranoidcoding.com/2019/04/08/string-vs-String-is-not-about-style.html),

it depends on your [namespace](https://medium.com/@morgankenyon/under-the-hood-of-c-alias-types-and-namespaces-82504a02660e).

[Returning null](https://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2019/08/07/think-twice-before-returning-null.aspx) is not a small thing, 

just like [swapping vars in place](https://dev.to/mortoray/terrible-interview-question-swap-variables-without-a-temporary-22jp).


---

To be or not to be?

This is the question. 

Will you use [Cosmos DB](https://dev.to/petereysermans/things-i-wish-i-knew-before-i-got-started-with-cosmosdb-4o05)?

Try [EF Core](https://www.thereformedprogrammer.net/an-in-depth-study-of-cosmos-db-and-ef-core-3-0-database-provider), but pay attention.

---
<< [Unit of work](https://gunnarpeipman.com/ef-core-repository-unit-of-work/)! I'll start from here>>, 

or maybe Dapper, and something more?

That's not obvious, I'll be sincere, 

you might want [EF Core](https://exceptionnotfound.net/dapper-vs-entity-framework-core-query-performance-benchmarking-2019/).

---
[.NET Standard, Core and Framework](https://code-maze.com/differences-between-net-framework-net-core-and-net-standard/), 

you can see them all in action. 

Want performance? Want great work?

Take care of [Garbage Collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/memory?view=aspnetcore-3.0).

---
<< I wanna all remote! Remote [work](https://doist.com/blog/mental-health-and-remote-work), remote [calls](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/grpc-vs-http-apis/)! >>. 

If your boss allows it, just say Thanks!

If not, don't break his balls.

Be a nice person, just like [Tom Hanks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/movies/tom-hanks-mister-rogers.html).

My [source code is not a book](https://dev.to/snj/learn-from-source-code-4d1o), 

[few comments](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/opinion/opinion-pieces/fighting-evil-code-comments-comments/) - lots of defects.

[TDD](https://techblog.holidaycheck.com/post/2018/01/02/testing-code-that-isnt-there-yet), I had a look.

But, [only positive effects](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/exploding-software-engineering-myths/)??

--- 

Doesn't care if frontend or backend, 

remember to test - don't leave that empty gap -

[unit](https://blog.usejournal.com/lean-testing-or-why-unit-tests-are-worse-than-you-think-b6500139a009), [integration](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests), end 2 end, 

and you'll create a better app.

[Will you fail?](https://jamesclear.com/3-stages-of-failure) I can't tell.

You must [plan your career with attention](https://medium.com/better-programming/you-need-to-design-your-programming-career-f3d0b9803ca4). 

Ok, ya know [what is a shell](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/WhatsTheDifferenceBetweenAConsoleATerminalAndAShell.aspx)

Something cool to talk [at a convention](https://dev.to/nspinazz89/12-tips-to-maximize-your-experience-at-a-tech-conference-5dkj).

---

For 2020 I wanna speak at [another conference](https://code4it.wordpress.com/2019/10/20/thoughts-after-my-very-first-public-speech/),

and maybe [write with more regularity](https://www.ilonacodes.com/blog/most-common-blogging-mistakes-of-beginner-bloggers/), 

this will help me gain self-confidence,

and [increase my blog popularity](https://dev.to/brandonskerritt/how-to-go-from-3-views-to-1-000-308-30a9).
